### Travel Planner App

Inspired by my own travel planning experiences, this app is designed to streamline and digitize the travel planning process. Part of main functionailty of the app includes: 

1. Users can log in through a secure authentication process. 
2. Users can add upcoming trips to their dashboard. 
3. Each trip links to a detailed itinerary page, navigable via React Router. 
4. Users can search for hotels, activities, and attractions using the TripAdvisor API. 
5. These search results can be added to any trip itinerary. 
6. A sidebar provides a concise overview of the items in each trip.

Developing this travel planner app, from conception to deployment, gave me valuable experience building a full-stack application. I deepened my knowledge of API integration, including working with the TripAdvisor API to fetch real-time data. On the backend, I strengthened my skills in Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, implementing secure authentication and efficient data handling. On the frontend, I expanded my understanding of React's state management to create a responsive and seamless user interface.
