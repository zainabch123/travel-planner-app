Travel Planner App

Inspired by my own travel planning experiences, this app is designed to streamline and digitize the travel planning process. Part of main functionailty of the app includes:
Users can log in through a secure authentication process.
Users can add upcoming trips to their dashboard.
Each trip links to a detailed itinerary page, navigable via React Router.
Users can search for hotels, activities, and attractions using the TripAdvisor API.
These search results can be added to any trip itinerary.
A sidebar provides a concise overview of the items in each trip.

Developing this travel planner app, from conception to deployment, gave me valuable experience building a full-stack application. I deepened my knowledge of API integration, including working with the TripAdvisor API to fetch real-time data. On the backend, I strengthened my skills in Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, implementing secure authentication and efficient data handling. On the frontend, I expanded my understanding of React's state management to create a responsive and seamless user interface.
